The allocation_instrumentation diff is meant to be the same as the
main jRate diff, but with (most) Object and array allocation sites
instrumented.  Expect *A LOT* of output along stderr in any programs
you link with an allocation_instrumentation-patched libgcj!

If you use shared libraries, you can build an allocation-instrumented
libgcj and a non-allocation-instrumented libgcj and choose which to
use at runtime.
